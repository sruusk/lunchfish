This Sailfish OS project proudly displays Oulu University restaurant menus, because sometimes you just need a digital nudge to confirm that youâ€™re hungry.

## Features
- **Restaurant List**: A curated selection of Oulu University restaurants, or a list of places to avoid.
- **Daily Menus**: Peruse the daily offerings, or just scroll through and pretend you care.
- **Ingredient Details**: Uncover the secrets of your food, or just stare blankly at the screen.

## Project Structure
- `qml/pages/HomePage.qml`: The gateway to your culinary adventure, or a portal to procrastination.
- `qml/pages/RestaurantPage.qml`: Where you can pretend to be a food critic while scrolling through menus.
- `qml/pages/IngredientsPage.qml`: A deep dive into the world of ingredients, or a rabbit hole of confusion.
- `qml/pages/AboutPage.qml`: A humble brag about the app's existence, or a desperate plea for validation.
